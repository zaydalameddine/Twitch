# Analyze Data From Twitch

This data has been taken from Twitch. I analyzed the data in these sets using SQL and Python each with different purposes. The script for my queries in SQLite and in Python will be shown in this repository. 
See www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science for a list of the data and code we've published:

- [Hacker News](hacker-news)
- [StreetEasy](streeteasy)
- [Twitch](twitch)
- [Warby Parker](warby-parker)
- [Yelp](yelp)
